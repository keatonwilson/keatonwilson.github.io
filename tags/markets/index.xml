      <description>Hi there! It’s been a while! Sorry for the delay on posting, but things have been a bit crazy with the transition between the end of the semester at UA and moving into Summer research projects! I’ve also become a little obsessed with the Tidy Tuesday challenge on Twitter - it’s a cool project for the #r4ds (R for Data Science) community that sends out weekly datasets that Twitterfolks can munge and visualize with the fantastic tidyverse packages.</description>

      <description>The gist Let’s dive a bit deeper into the bean project - this post is the first in a series that will hopefully get at the meat of the project. One of the main questions of this endeavor is: Can we build a model that does a good job of predicting future market prices?
More generally: If I know something about the price of garbanzo beans today, and some of the market characteristics, can I predict with a good degree of accuracy what the price will be 6 months from now?</description>

      <description>Beans I’m the son of a bean broker. Both my dad and his dad worked in the dry bean industry in the US - which seems niche, but it’s really fascinating. When I originally started thinking about applying data science tools to problems outside of academia (in my case, outside of plants and insects and ecology), I immediately thought of beans. It’s something my father and I have talked about frequently, and a world I’ve always been interested in.</description>
