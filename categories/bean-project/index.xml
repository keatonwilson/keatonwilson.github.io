      <description>Updating the predictive bean model with new data The predictive model we’ve been exploring so far is based on data from the USDA Economic Research Service, whose database only goes to ~2011. This is a lot of data we’re missing from 2011 to the present - something we would want to incorporate into the model to improve accuracy. I recent corresponded with someone at USDA and was able to track down the rest of the data, so I’m excited to present an updated model, some predictions, and some additional insights we can gain from visualizing the model output in a couple of ways.</description>

      <description>Hi there! It’s been a while! Sorry for the delay on posting, but things have been a bit crazy with the transition between the end of the semester at UA and moving into Summer research projects! I’ve also become a little obsessed with the Tidy Tuesday challenge on Twitter - it’s a cool project for the #r4ds (R for Data Science) community that sends out weekly datasets that Twitterfolks can munge and visualize with the fantastic tidyverse packages.</description>

      <title>Class Market Share - A better visualization</title>

      <description>Better viz Anna Cates, a blog reader and soil ecologist working at the University of Wisconsin-Madison had a great suggestion for visualizing market-share change over time for different varietals - the stacked bar chart! I thought I’d write a brief post with some code!

      <title>Data Exploration and Visualization on Bean Market Data</title>

      <description>Data Exploration I wanted to take a break this week from Machine Learning and prediction algorithms on the bean data and do a bit of data exploration and visualization of what is a pretty rich data set. The idea here is a bit of a conceptual switch from what we’ve been exploring - here, I’m interested in picking apart trends in the market, and examining relationships between the variables.
First, let’s import the data from github and get the appropriate packages loaded:</description>

      <description>Goals As I’ve discussed in earlier posts, the basic premise of this project was to use a nice (but messy) dataset from the USDA on domestic bean markets to explore a variety of different avenues of analysis, visualization and data exploration. One of the main goals of this project was to see if I could build some machine learning models that do a good job of predicting future prices of different classes of beans.</description>

      <title>Preprocessing Bean Data (on the road to Machine Learning)</title>

      <description>The gist Let’s dive a bit deeper into the bean project - this post is the first in a series that will hopefully get at the meat of the project. One of the main questions of this endeavor is: Can we build a model that does a good job of predicting future market prices?
More generally: If I know something about the price of garbanzo beans today, and some of the market characteristics, can I predict with a good degree of accuracy what the price will be 6 months from now?</description>

      <description>Messy Excel Files So, as I discussed last time, the first big hurdle in starting to explore the domestic dry bean market data was overcoming the terror of working with a bunch of really messy, really gnarly excel files.
The main one looks like this:Lots of problems, right? The data are in multiple sheets in a single workbook, they’re not uniform, etc. It’s an R-user’s nightmare, but the reality is that data often look like this.</description>

      <description>Beans I’m the son of a bean broker. Both my dad and his dad worked in the dry bean industry in the US - which seems niche, but it’s really fascinating. When I originally started thinking about applying data science tools to problems outside of academia (in my case, outside of plants and insects and ecology), I immediately thought of beans. It’s something my father and I have talked about frequently, and a world I’ve always been interested in.</description>
